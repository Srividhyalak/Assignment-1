            <h1>ABOUT BRAND</h1>
            <p>Brands live or die by their ability to connect with potential customers. Turn on any television worldwide, and it won’t be long until you see adverts from famous brands such as Coca-cola, Apple, Heineken and many more household names.

                These adverts are all part of brand awareness campaigns, and businesses launch these campaigns to get their brands in front of their target customers, with the end goal of eventually driving more sales. </p>

            <h1>BRAND SPRIT</h1>
            <p>A brand sprint is an expressive exercise that helps turn ideas about your brand into a defined brand image. A brand sprint can help your company find its place in the competitive landscape. </p>
             <P>The Google brand sprint relies on doing activities on posters and whiteboards, so I built a board specifically for the brand sprint and created all the content for the framework in advance. What I’ve noticed with distributed work is that it’s really important to do the prep work in advance, especially if you’re running a workshop like the brand sprint.</P>

    <div class ="box">
        <p> You can use these kinds of brand exercises whenever your company is looking to redesign or create a great brand. Your brand sprint won’t always follow this exact flow, so be sure to experiment with any special expertise your team members have. Try smaller design sprints or split up into teams to bring forward ideas on growing your company’s brand for mass appeal in your market.</p>
